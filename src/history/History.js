                            Suits U Montreal is founded by a couple of McGill students. One suit sale is held along with a tie sale and some other minor fundraising events like churro sales. Partnerships with local businesses begin to form with law firms like Blake's and McCarthy TÃ©trault donating suits and Tim Hortons providing coffee for events. All profits are donated to Sun Youth.

                            Suits U Montreal joins McGill's Management Undergraduate Society (MUS) where it is now officially affiliated with McGill University. A suit sale is held in the fall in McGill's famous Arts building leading to the highest event turnout and profit. Over $1000 is donated to McGill Students' for Parkinson's Awareness. Suits U Montreal is represented at Fashion Business Uncovered's 2019 conference with two club members as panelists.

In the fall, resume writing and cover letter tips are delivered through online vidoes in partnership with AIESEC.
