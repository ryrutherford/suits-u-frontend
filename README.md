# Suits U Montreal Frontend

## Description
Due to the pandemic, Suits U Montreal, the student run non profit club which provides students with opportunities to purchase gently used business attire at affordable prices has decided to move some of its operations online.

As the co-president of the club and a Computer Science major, I worked to help make this happen. When complete, the website will act as Suits U Montreal's interface to our community. Our products will be displayed online, students will be allowed to reserve items through the website and then pick them up at a convenient time. For the sake of security and to avoid issues with non-students or non-Montrealers purchasing our items we decided against integrating a payment system in our website. As such it's not a fully fledged e-commmerce site but it comes pretty close!

## Tools Used
- The frontend was built entirely using React
- I did all the styling myself using SASS
- I used Apollo GraphQL to query my MongoDB database in order to get the products, categories, sizes etc.
- A lot of the work for the backend was handled by Strapi (a headless CMS built in Node.js)
